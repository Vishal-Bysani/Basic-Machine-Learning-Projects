# Basic-Machine-Learning-Projects

This repository consists of the primary projects in machine learning I did while learning PyTorch.

## Project 1: Logistic Regression for Cardiovascular Risk Prediction

- Utilized PyTorch for **logistic regression** on Framingham, Massachusetts residents' cardiovascular study data, predicting 10-year risk of **coronary heart disease**.
- Analyzed over 4,000 records with 15 attributes such as age, BMI, cholesterol levels, and more, aiding in early prognosis and lifestyle decisions for high-risk patients.

## Project 2: Convolutional Neural Network for MNIST Dataset

- Implemented a fundamental **Convolutional Neural Network** using PyTorch.
- Successfully identified images from the **MNIST dataset** with high precision.
- 

Feel free to explore each project's directory for more details and code implementations.
